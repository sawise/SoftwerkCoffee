(- Why is the PHP-page displaying "ERROR" when coffee is done?)

- Coffeestatus on PHP-page barely readable, change?

- Echo on top of page, remove?

- Make time 00:00:00-format

- Change "Coffeepowder" to "Loaded"

- When coffee is done, coffeemachine should still be "ON" in app

- User should be able to switch off coffeemachine even when it's not loaded (but not switch on, obviously)

- Two tabs in app: Main view and History
	- Main view contains coffeepot + functions (on, off, time etc)
	- History contains user history and statistics
		- Who loaded the coffeemachine and when
		- Who swiched the coffeemachine ON/OFF
		- Statistics
			- How much coffe (litres, cups) has been consumed?
				- This week
				- This month
				- All time
			- How many pots has been brewed
				- This week
				- This month
				- All time
		- Split view History / Statistics (?)
		- History as TableView (?)

- Autoswitch OFF function (switches off coffeemachine at specific time (18:00))
	- Time should be changeable in Settings

- Compability
	- Switches for API 14+
	- ToggleButtons for lower API:s (?)

(- Salt hash)

- Properly track time in Redmine
